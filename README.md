# A-Little-More

## How to compile
Rename "index.example.js" to "index.js" and provide your own API key if you want the weather stuff to work.

## TODO
- Clay config page
  - Temperature unit toggle
  - Easier API key specification
  - Colors for Basalt/Chalk/Emery?
  - Inversion for Aplite/Diorite/Flint?
- Figure out where to put weather conditions
  - Because we do fetch them
  - And then do literally nothing with them
  - So once I figure that out, stick in a toggle for it on the Clay page
 
## FAQ
