# A-Little-More

## How to compile
- Rename "index.nokey.js" to "index.js" and provide your own OpenWeatherMap API key if you want the weather stuff to work.
- Build as normal for a Pebble app. I use the local SDK because I'm really cool, but you can use the CloudPebble Codespace if you're sane: https://codespaces.new/coredevices/codespaces-pebble?quickstart=1

## TODO
- Fix "Wednesd..." (done)
- Clay config page (kinda done)
  - Temperature unit toggle (done)
  - Easier API key specification (done)
  - Colors for Basalt/Chalk/Emery?
  - Inversion for Aplite/Diorite/Flint?
- Figure out where to put weather conditions
  - Because we do fetch them
  - And then do literally nothing with them
  - So once I figure that out, stick in a toggle for it on the Clay page
